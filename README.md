Angular Cube

==========

I wanted recently to have css3 transitions - rotating of a cube - as a transition from one view to another, but didn't know of a good way to do this in angular, so I built one.

Built with:
[ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router)
Intro to CSS 3D transforms by David DeSandro -[link](http://desandro.github.io/3dtransforms/docs/cube.html)
